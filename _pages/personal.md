My name in simplified Chinese is 唐振宇 (read as "t'ang chen yu"). I also speak some Japanese (my name in Hiragana: たん じぇんゆ) and am still teaching myself. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar a lot. I'm the lead guitarist in our 4-piece rock band [RM-RF](https://www.instagram.com/rmrfband/) active in the San Francisco Bay Area. Occasionally, I upload my guitar recordings to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/01RoyJames). I enjoy most music genres, especially J-pop, post-rock, and classical music. I was a member of Zhejiang University's Guitar Club throughout my undergraduate, where I made many good friends.
