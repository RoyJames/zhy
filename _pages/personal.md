My name in simplified Chinese is 唐振宇 (read as "t'ang chen yu"). I also speak some Japanese (my name in Hiragana: たん じぇんゆ) and am still teaching myself. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing classical and acoustic guitars a lot. Ocassionally, I upload my guitar recordings to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/01RoyJames). I enjoy most music genres, especially J-pop, post-rock, and classical music. I was a member of Zhejiang University's Guitar Club throughout my undergraduate, where I made many good friends.

In addition, I am a big anime/manga fan. My all-time favorite one is *Fullmetal Alchemist*. Now addicted to *Fate* series. I also play console games (mainly RPG) if my friends are online. That's basically how I stay safe at home :)
