I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland-College Park. I am also a member of [GAMMA group](http://gamma.web.unc.edu/), supervised by Professor [Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dm/biography.html). I received my B.E. (with Honor) from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/english/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in July, 2017. My undergraduate supervisor was Professor [Hongzhi Wu](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/hwu/), in the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html).

My main interests and previous research involve Computer Graphics (sound rendering, lighting & appearance modeling), Computational Photography and Human-Computer Interaction. And I am passionate in enhancing real-world experience in the digital world (e.g. AR and VR). 

I was a research intern at the [Visualization and Interface Design Innovation (ViDi)](https://vidi.cs.ucdavis.edu/) research group in the University of California, Davis in summer 2016. I worked with Professor [Kwan-Liu Ma](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ma/)'s team on several visualization projects, and developed [LightPainter](https://vidi.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yilchen/LightPainter/index.html).

I'am currently pursuing projects involving spatial sound rendering in virtual environments, and the application of sound simulation in real-world (e.g. soundfields, localization, de-reverberation). If you have interesting thoughts or would like to collaborate, you are welcome to contact me.
