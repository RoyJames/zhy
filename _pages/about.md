I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland-College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/). I am also a member of the [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/) and the [GAMMA group](http://gamma.umd.edu/), supervised by Professor [Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dm/biography.html). I received my B.E. (with Honor) from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/english/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in July, 2017. My undergraduate supervisor was Professor [Hongzhi Wu](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/hwu/), in the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html).

My main interests and previous research involve Computer Graphics (sound rendering, lighting & appearance modeling), Computational Photography and Human-Computer Interaction. And I am passionate in enhancing real-world experience in the digital world (e.g. AR and VR). 

My earlier work involves [sound synthesis and propagation projects](https://gamma.umd.edu/researchdirections/sound/main) mainly for VR and AR applications. Recently, I am working on [far-field speech recognition and related projects](https://gamma.umd.edu/researchdirections/speech/main) leveraging better acoustic simulations. If you have interesting thoughts or would like to collaborate, you are welcome to contact me.
