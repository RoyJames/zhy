I graduated with PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Maryland-College Park](http://www.cs.umd.edu/) in 2022. I currently work as a senior research scientist in the Voice Modeling Team, Meta Superintelligence Lab in its Menlo Park office.

My recent main research interests are speech synthesis & analysis, speech large language models, (diffusion) generative models. My previous work involves [sound synthesis and propagation projects](https://gamma.umd.edu/researchdirections/sound/main) mainly for VR and AR applications and [audio/speech processing projects](https://gamma.umd.edu/researchdirections/speech/main) leveraging better acoustic simulations. I am open to exploring new research areas and collaborations.
If you are interested in joining our team as a researcher or intern, feel free to drop me an email.

I was a member of the [GAMMA group](http://gamma.umd.edu/) and the [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/), supervised by Professor [Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dm/biography.html). I received my B.E. (with Honor) from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in July, 2017. My undergraduate supervisor was Professor [Hongzhi Wu](http://hongzhiwu.com/), with whom I worked on Computer Graphics research.
